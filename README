what is it?
===========

This is my custom modification to the fbi linux program. Fbi is used to 
display images using only the frame buffer. The slide show feature is 
excellent if you are trying to create a splash screen for the 
Raspberry Pi. The on issue with the standard fbi (at creation of this
mod) is that you could only use integer values for the delay period
of the slide show. This meant that you could not have a delay of less
than 1 second. This mod fixes that and allows floats for the delay 
period


install
=====
The easiest way to install this is:

1. Compile it into a .deb file (Check INSTALL instructions)
2. Add the package "sudo dpkg -i fbi_2.07-10_armhf.deb"
